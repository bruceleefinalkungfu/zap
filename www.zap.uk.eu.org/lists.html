<H1>Zap mailing lists</H1>

<P>
There are a range of mailing lists pertaining to Zap, which are listed
below. These lists are run using ezmlm, which is a mailing list manager you
might not have come across before. Briefly, to subscribe to a list called
foop@zap.uk.eu.org, send email to foop-subscribe@zap.uk.eu.org. If you want
to subscribe under a different email address, use
foop-subscribe-my.address=mydomain.com@zap.uk.eu.org - you need to replace
the 'at' (@) in your email address with an equals sign (=). After sending
your subscription request, you will be emailed to confirm the request.
</P>

<P>
ezmlm is fairly easy to use, and allows you to easily subscribe yourself
under a different email address even if it is difficult for you to send from
it. For more information, look at <A
HREF="http://www.ezmlm.org/ezman/ezman1.html">http://www.ezmlm.org/ezman/ezman1.html</A>.
</P>

<P>
All Zap lists are 'open' except announce; that is, you don't have to be
subscribed to the lists to post to them (this is particularly important for
things like the bug list). announce is moderated; each message sent to it is
checked first by one of the Zap development team. Please try to ensure that
you send your message to the correct list (especially in the case of bugs,
because they should get fixed faster if they get sent to the right place :-).
</P>

<DL>
 <DT><A HREF="mailto:buglist@zap.uk.eu.org">buglist</A>
  <DD>This is the list where bug reports are discussed. Please do
<EM>not</EM> send bug reports to this address; use <A
HREF="mailto:bugs@zap.uk.eu.org">bugs@zap.uk.eu.org</A> instead.<BR>
  <A HREF="mailto:buglist-subscribe@zap.uk.eu.org">Subscribe to buglist</A>

 <DT><A HREF="mailto:beta@zap.uk.eu.org">beta</A>
  <DD>This is the discussion list for people participating in beta testing
of Zap. (You can 'become' a beta tester simply by <A
HREF="download.html">downloading</A> the latest beta version and starting to
use it.) Please do <EM>not</EM> send beta bug reports to this address; use
<A HREF="mailto:betabugs@zap.uk.eu.org">betabugs@zap.uk.eu.org</A> instead.<BR>
  <A HREF="mailto:beta-subscribe@zap.uk.eu.org">Subscribe to beta</A>

 <DT><A HREF="mailto:features@zap.uk.eu.org">features</A>
  <DD>A largely non-technical list for discussion of proposed new
features.<BR>
  <A HREF="mailto:features-subscribe@zap.uk.eu.org">Subscribe to features</A>

 <DT><A HREF="mailto:devel@zap.uk.eu.org">devel</A>
  <DD>A largely technical list for discussion of alterations and additions<BR>
to the core of Zap.
  <A HREF="mailto:devel-subscribe@zap.uk.eu.org">Subscribe to devel</A>

 <DT><A HREF="mailto:technical@zap.uk.eu.org">technical</A>
  <DD>Other technical issues: this is where to ask questions such as
&quot;How do I write a mode/command to do ...&quot;<BR>
  <A HREF="mailto:technical-subscribe@zap.uk.eu.org">Subscribe to technical</A>

 <DT>announce (moderated)
  <DD>A list to which announcements of important changes is made. In general
these announcements will also be posted to comp.sys.acorn.announce.<BR>
  <A HREF="mailto:announce-subscribe@zap.uk.eu.org">Subscribe to announce</A>

</DL>

<P>
In addition, all the above lists except announce are available as <EM>digest
lists</EM>; digests get sent every thirty messages, 64K of message bodies,
or 48 hours. (A digest will actually be sent when a message arrives on the
list, so low volume lists won't work well as digests; but then low volume
lists don't <EM>need</EM> to work well as digests :-). To subscribe to a
list as a digest, use foop-digest-subscribe@zap.uk.eu.org instead of
foop-subscribe@zap.uk.eu.org
</P>

<P>
If you need to filter mail from these lists, the best way to do it is to
filter on the Mailing-List or Delivered-To headers. These will appear
something like below. (If you need it, we have information specific to
<A HREF="newsbase.html">filtering the Zap mailing lists with Newsbase</A>.)
</P>

<PRE>
Mailing-List: contact announce-help@zap.uk.eu.org; run by ezmlm
Delivered-To: mailing list announce@zap.uk.eu.org
