Zap is a programmer's editor for Acorn RiscOS. It has a large number of features designed to facilitate programming (particularly source code), as well as full text editing facilities. It is also highly configurable and extensible. There is a <A HREF="faq.html">list of frequently asked questions</A>, and their answers.
</P>

<P>
If you wish to get in touch with the Zap development team then please use
the appropriate email address from the <A HREF="contact.html">contact
page</A>. If you wish to get involved in the development effort, you will
probably want to subscribe to one or more of the <A
HREF="lists.html">mailing lists</A>. Before reporting a bug or making a
suggestion, we advise checking the Changes file in the current Zap
distribution to see if it has already been dealt with. Hopefully in the
future this website will contain lists of proposed features, known bugs, and
recent changes - for now you'll have to download Zap itself.
</P>

<P>
We hope you find Zap a useful program.
