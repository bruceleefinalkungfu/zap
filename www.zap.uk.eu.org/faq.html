<h1 align=center>Zap 1.40 FAQ.</h1>

<P>
<EM>This FAQ covers common issues raised by the current version of Zap only - it is not intended to be a general Zap FAQ.</EM>. Answers to many of the frequently asked questions about Zap are addressed in the relevant !Help files. This document does not attempt to address questions such as &quot;Can I get a program like Zap for other operating-systems?&quot; either.

<LI><H3><a name="q01" href="#q01">Where can this FAQ be obtained?</a></H3>

<P>
It normally resides at <A HREF="http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/faq.html">http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/faq.html</A> and it is included in the main distribution as <code>!Zap.Docs.FAQ</code>.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q02" href="#q25">Where can Zap be downloaded?</a></H3>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/">http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/</A> is the main Zap web site.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q03" href="#q03">Why doesn't OLE from Fresco work?</a></H3>

<P>
If you tick <code>Options.Misc.Be Tolerant</code> in <EM>Zap's</EM> icon bar menu then it will work. This is necessary because <EM>Fresco</EM> supports a slightly unorthodox variant of the OLE protocol.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q04" href="#q04">OLE now works, but why does it give errors messages?</a></H3>

<P>
They're as unobtrusive warnings as is possible. It is felt that some kind of warning is necessary otherwise programmers might not notice that their programs have problems which will cause them to fail to work properly with some existing OLE clients.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q05" href="#q05">Why does Edit gets loaded these days and not Zap?</a></H3>

<P>
When <EM>Zap</EM> gets booted by the filer it no longer claims shift-double-clicks on files, text files, task windows, OLE, or 'external edits', if these have been claimed by another application. The simplest solution to the problem of <EM>Edit</EM> loading is simply not to boot <EM>Edit</EM> in the first place.
</P>

<P>
Unfortunately, on machines with <EM>Edit</EM> in ROM, this may not be a simple process.
</P>

<P>
As a consequence of this difficulty in uninstalling <EM>Edit</EM>, an '<EM>Obey</EM>' file is provided which 'unboots' any other editors which the filer has seen.
</P>

<P>
There is a call to this file at the top of <CODE>!ZapUser.Config.!ZapBoot</CODE>. It is commented out by default.
</P>

<P>
Some applications have been known to start up the resident text editor manually and the method used does not always work with this version of Zap.  Sometimes contacting the author of the application can resolve such matters.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q06" href="#q06">Will other programs which use ZapRedraw work OK?</a></H3>

<P>
They <EM>should</EM> do. The new interface was designed to be backwards-compatible with the old one and there are no known problems.
</P>

<P>
If, however any such applications expect to find bitmap fonts within the <CODE>!Zap</CODE> application directory structure, then they may find themselves looking in the wrong place.
</P>

<P>
There appear to have been some problems with people using multiple copies of ZapFonts on their system - sometimes the one which gets booted first does not contain all the expected fonts.  ZapFonts is intended to be a central resource and it is best to ensure that you maintain a central copy of it.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q07" href="#q07">Can I use my old !Config file with the new version?</a></H3>

<P>
Yes. If you do this then some of the new options will be turned off by default, though. There are plans to make Zap store its version number in the !Config file and switch on new options if it recognises that the file was last used with an old version of <EM>Zap</EM>.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q08" href="#q08">Where do I put my '!Config' file, then?</a></H3>

<P>
In the <CODE>!Zap.!ZapUser.Config</CODE> directory. All files which might need to be edited are now stored there.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q09" href="#q09">Can I use my old 'Keys' file with the new version?</a></H3>

<P>
Generally speaking, yes, but it's probably best to copy only the bits you need. There are significant additions which make discarding the new <CODE>Keys</CODE> file less than attractive.<br>
The old <CODE>Keys</CODE> file has been split up into <CODE>Keys</CODE>, <CODE>Settings</CODE>, <CODE>TypesHigh</CODE> and <CODE>TypesLow</CODE> files.
</P>

<P>
Note also that brackets in key definitions are treated slightly differently from <EM>Zap 1.35</EM>.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q10" href="#q10">Can I use my old 'Menus' file with the new version?</a></H3>

<P>
This isn't recommended. If there are specific bits of the menu file that you've added then by all means copy these across (carefully). The <CODE>Menus</CODE> file has been significantly added to. Using an old file would be a huge waste.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q11" href="#q11">Can I use my old 'External' file with the new version?</a></H3>

<P>
No. <CODE>External</CODE> files are generated automatically as part of Zap's plug-and-play extension installation scheme. The <CODE>External</CODE> file still exists but now never needs to be edited by the user.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q12" href="#q12">Why isn't 'HidePtr' loaded with Zap these days?</a></H3>

<P>
Because it's not universally popular. Loading it automatically is an <EM>option</EM> available from the <CODE>Options.Misc.Autoload</CODE> menu.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q13" href="#q13">SoftWrap mode is missing! What have you done with it?</a></H3>

<P>
There's no <EM>SoftWrap</EM> mode any more because soft-wrap is now a <EM>wrap option</EM> for most modes. As <EM>Text</EM> mode can now perform soft-wrap, there's no longer any need for a separate <EM>SoftWrap</EM> mode.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q14" href="#q14">Why does Zap sometimes fail to take notice of Shift and Ctrl?</a></H3>

<P>
This can only occur when Zap is using the <EM>KeyboardExtend</EM> module. Other
applications which do not correctly process the key up/down event (upon which
<EM>KeyboardExtend</EM> relies) will cause synchronisation problems.
</P>

<P>
To fix any such problems, simply issue <CODE>*RMReinit KeyboardExtend</CODE>.
</P>

<P>
Known problem applications and modules:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>!PC.DivaRM<BR>
Module is: <CODE>386Support 1.90 (14 Sep 1995)</CODE><BR>
Fix: Load into Zap, goto address <CODE>&amp;3E4 (LDMFD
R13!,{R0-R4,R14,PC}^)</CODE>, press <CODE>Return</CODE>, delete the
<CODE>&quot;,R14&quot;</CODE>, press <CODE>Return</CODE>, then save.<BR>
Other versions may be similarly affected.<BR>

</UL>

<P></P><!-- Arg, I hate MSIE -->

<LI><H3><a name="q15" href="#q15">I hear Zap has a problems when run on the A7000+?</a></H3>

<P>
A7000+s (and <EM>possibly</EM> some other computers), appear to have corrupt versions of some of the ROM fonts, notably <EM>Homerton.Medium.Oblique</EM>. Viewing this can cause the desktop font to be reset to the system font.
</P>

<P>
Unfortunately the default Zap template set uses some of these; the best solution is to switch to a different template set if it bothers you.
</P>

<LI><H3><a href="#q16">Why doesn't <EM>OLE</EM> with <EM>ArcWeb</EM> work?</a></H3>

<P>
It <EM>should</EM> do, but you have to make sure that you save files in the same spot that <EM>ArcWeb</EM> told <EM>Zap</EM> to load them from. If you save them elsewhere, <EM>Zap</EM> dutifully informs <EM>ArcWeb</EM> of this, but it doesn't appear to become aware that the file has moved.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q17" href="#q17">Zap mode &lt;x&gt; isn't included - can I plug it in?</a></H3>

<P>
Probably.  Plugging in <EM>SoftWrap</EM> mode, or <EM>ZapOLE</EM>, is not recommended though. The functionality of these has been taken over by <EM>Zap</EM> internally.
</P>

<P>
Versions of the <EM>old</EM> 'CMode', and the <EM>old</EM> Email mode and 'ZapUtils' which should work with <EM>Zap 1.40</EM> exist. If anyone still wants to use them for some reason, they can try the versions distributed with Zap 1.35, or they can try mailing us.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q18" href="#q18">What are the recent changes?</a></H3>

<P>
The changes since the first 1.39 beta release are covered by the <!-- A
HREF="http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/documentation/recent.html" -->recent
changes<!-- /A --> file.
</P>

<P>
The changes since 1.35 release are covered in the <!-- A
HREF="http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/documentation/changes.html" -->Docs.Changes<!-- /A --> file.
</P>

<P>
Zap's history prior to version 1.35 will hopefully be made available on <A HREF="http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/">the Zap web site</a> at some point.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q19" href="#q19">What is planned for future versions?</a></H3>

<P>
Well, there is an extensive list of wished-for features and possible improvements, though this is not publicly available at this stage.
</P>

<P>
Some of the plans have been documented as a component of a discussion phase prior to their implementation and these documents may be made available of <A HREF="http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/">the Zap web site</a> at some stage.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q20" href="#q20">Is there a list of known bugs somewhere?</a></H3>

<P>
Not yet - again this may be made available on <A HREF="http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/">the web site</a>.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q21" href="#q21">Why does Zap 1.40 take up more memory than Zap 1.35?</a></H3>

<P>
Because it has more features than <EM>Zap 1.35</EM>. Where possible these have been put into extension modes, but some things are best placed centrally. In particular, OLE, window wrap, soft-wrap, and support for the global clipboard are now all present in the core.
</P>

<P>
Anyway, <EM>Zap</EM> is still pretty slender. If you want to minimise memory usage, you can try not using so many font sub-styles, or switch to using a VDU-drawn font.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q22" href="#q22">Why does Zap 1.40 load more slowly than Zap 1.35?</a></H3>

<P>
Two main reasons:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>CreateConf and ConfigScan.

<P>
Between them these programs automatically generate <EM>Zap</EM>'s configuration files if any files have been modified since last time <EM>Zap</EM> was run. This involves scanning the <CODE>Modules</CODE> directory to see if anything has changed since the last time <EM>Zap</EM> was run, which can take a second or so. It allows plug-and-play installation of extension modules. It is fairly easy to revert to manual <EM>Zap 1.35</EM>-style configuration (by removing the calls to CreateConf and ConfigScan in the !Run file), but this really isn't recommended.
</P>

<LI>Loading extra bitmap font styles.

<P>
When you double-click on a file, if <EM>Zap</EM> loads a file which needs additional fonts which aren't in its bitmap font cache, then it has to load these from disc and cache them in the current screen mode. This can take a moment or two, and obviously wasn't a problem on <EM>Zap 1.35</EM> where it wasn't possible to have different modes defaulting to using different fonts, or to have multiple font-styles in a single view.
</P>

</UL>

<LI><H3><a name="q23" href="#q23">Can I delete Zap 1.35, then?</a></H3>

<P>
If you're short of space.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q24" href="#q24">Are there mailing lists where people discuss Zap?</a></H3>

<P>
Yes; originally we had <CODE>zap-devel</CODE>, which you may have heard something about. However this has now been replaced by several lists for different purposes. There is a <A HREF="http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/lists.html">page about the lists</A> on the web site.
</P>

<LI><H3><a name="q25" href="#q25">I've found a bug! What should I do?</a></H3>

<P>
Tell us about it. <a href="mailto:tim@zap.uk.eu.org">Tim</a> can forward mail to the relevant parties if you're not sure who to contact. Alternatively, emailing <A HREF="mailto:bugs@zap.uk.eu.org">bugs@zap.uk.eu.org</A> will get your bug report to the buglist; this is the preferred method, since it will allow us to easily keep a track of the bug reports we receive.
