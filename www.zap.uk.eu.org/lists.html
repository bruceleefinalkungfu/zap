<H1>Zap mailing lists</H1>

<P>
There are a range of mailing lists pertaining to Zap, which are listed
below. They are run using <A HREF="http://www.lists.org/">GNU Mailman</A>;
you can subscribe via the <A
HREF="http://lists.tartarus.org/mailman/listinfo">web interface</A>, or by
sending an email to <EM>&lt;listname&gt;-request@zap.uk.eu.org</EM> with the
text <TT>subscribe</TT> in either the subject line or body. The list server
will send back a confirmation email which contains instructions on how to
finalise your subscription.
</P>

<P>
The web interface also allows you to configure some aspects of your
subscription, such as whether you receive the list as posts are sent to it,
or as a regular digest. You can also access the list archives in this way.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Note that we recently changed the names of the lists. Where previously
they would have been of the form <EM>beta@zap.uk.eu.org</EM>, they are now
<EM>zap-beta@zap.uk.eu.org</EM>.</STRONG>
</P>

<P>
All Zap lists are 'open' except announce; that is, you don't have to be
subscribed to the lists to post to them (this is particularly important for
things like the bug list). announce is moderated; each message sent to it is
checked first by one of the Zap development team. Please try to ensure that
you send your message to the correct list (especially in the case of bugs,
because they should get fixed faster if they get sent to the right place :-).
</P>

 <DT><A HREF="mailto:zap-buglist@zap.uk.eu.org">zap-buglist</A>
  <DD>This is the list where bug reports are discussed. Please do
<EM>not</EM> send bug reports to this address; use <A
HREF="mailto:bugs@zap.uk.eu.org">bugs@zap.uk.eu.org</A> instead.<BR>

Note that email to this list will have its <EM>Reply-To</EM> header set to
the list. This is evil, and I shouldn't do it, but I discovered I more or
less had to, because so many people were replying to the bug submission
email address instead of the list. See <A
HREF="http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html">Reply-To Munging
Considered Harmful</A> for an overview of why this makes me shiver
uncontrollably. Ideally I'll write a small filter which will add
<EM>Reply-To</EM> to emails coming in from the submission address
<EM>only</EM>, so I can remove this.<BR>

<P>
If you need to filter mail from these lists, the best way to do it is to filter on the List-Id header. This will appear something like below. (If you need it, we have information specific to <A HREF="mailers.html">using the Zap mailing lists with Acorn mail software</A>.)
