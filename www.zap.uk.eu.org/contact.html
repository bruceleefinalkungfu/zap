<H1>Zap contact details</H1>

<P>
We prefer to be contacted via email; if you really need to write to us, write to James at the address given below.
</P>

<P>
General email addresses. Note that the following are actually lists; for instance, the features address is a list for discussing the proposed features as well as suggesting them. For information on how to subscribe to the lists, as well as more detailed descriptions of all the Zap-related lists, see the <A HREF="lists.html">Zap mailing lists page</A>. Before reporting a bug or suggesting a feature, try to make sure it hasn't already been reported/proposed (this is difficult until we collate the lists of each).
</P>

<A NAME="ds"></A>
<H2>Darren Salt</H2>

<P>
Darren maintains ZapEmail and ZapBASIC. In the core, he is responsible (amongst other things) for the command language, ClickSend, menus, internationalisation, and mode handling (including clone modes).

<A NAME="sja"></A>
<H2>James Aylett</H2>

<P>
James maintains ZapFonts, the combined command extensions, the 'glue' (documentation, web and ftp sites, domain, mailing lists), and an air of omniscience. He is also responsible (amongst other things) for c-vars and the general shape of the distribution. He currently works at Insigma Technologies; please note that Zap has nothing to do with Insigma.

<A NAME="tmt"></A>
<H2>Tim Tyler</H2>

<P>
Tim did lots of the work on v1.40, including coordinating its release. He also wrote vast numbers of syntax colouring modes, and maintained Martin's programming modes. Since v1.40 Tim has decided to try to use his time more wisely (:-), and avoid getting dragged into Zap too much.

<H2>Justin Fletcher</H2>

<P>
Justin is responsible for enhancing Code mode beyond common sense, and a few other things. He's currently suffering from lack of time to devote to Zap (if 'suffering' is really the right word).

<A NAME="dhs"></A>
<H2>Dominic Symes</H2>

<P>
Dominic was the initial developer of Zap, and its sole maintainer until the end of 1996. Dominic now works at ARM Ltd (and doesn't have much time for Zap things - in general you should not direct queries to him); please note that Zap has nothing to do with ARM.

<A NAME="mje"></A>
<H2>Martin Ebourne</H2>

<P>
Martin wrote the C, C++, Java, Assembler and Pascal modes which probably form a lot of the use of Zap (at least by its current developers). He also wrote the plug and play auto-configuration system we've been using since v1.40.
